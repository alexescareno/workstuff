# A project using Python to scrape, transform, and visualize data using the public Titanic sample Database.


## This is a project that uses many techniques and libraries in Python to develop tools and visuals that can be used in a data analysis position


This is a project that uses python's robust libraries to determine the factors that helped someone survive 
the sinking of the Titanic as well as demoing graphs that are used to describe the survival rates between passenger classes
as well as showcasing the ability to use python to transform data, visualize data, and create reports by
using the following libraries:

  
  *Pandas, a robust data analysis and data manipulation tool
  
  *The building of arrays using Series
  
  *Using DataFrame to create data structures with rows and columns
  
  *Matplotlib for creating interactive data visualizations
  
  *Numpy for mathematical operations and data manipulation
  
  *Seaborn as a interface to Matplotlib in creating graphs
  
  *The use of Seaborn's countplots to create histograms
